## üìä How It Works

Book Haven uses collaborative filtering, a technique that filters information by using the interactions and data collected from other users. It identifies patterns in reading preferences to suggest books that similar users have enjoyed.

The recommendation engine follows these steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Processes book ratings from thousands of users
2. **Similarity Calculation**: Creates a matrix of book similarities
3. **Recommendation Generation**: Suggests books based on similarity scores
4. **Result Presentation**: Displays recommendations with book details and cover images

## üîç Dataset

The system is built on the Book-Crossing dataset, which contains:
- 271,360 books
- 1,149,780 ratings
- 278,858 users
